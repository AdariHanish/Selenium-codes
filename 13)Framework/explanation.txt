📁 1. base/ — Foundation of the Framework
✅ What it contains:
base_page.py: Reusable actions like click, send_keys, get_text, etc. with proper waits.

base_test.py: PyTest setup() fixture to initialize and close the browser.

🔗 Connection:
pages/ classes inherit from base_page.py.

testcases/ tests use the setup() fixture from base_test.py.

❌ If missing or broken:
Page methods like click() won’t work.

Test cases will fail to run due to missing WebDriver setup.

📁 2. pages/ — Page Object Classes (POM)
✅ What it contains:
Each Python file = one web page (e.g., home_page.py, search_results_page.py).

Contains locators and methods for interacting with that page.

🔗 Connection:
Uses BasePage methods from base/base_page.py.

Called in test cases from testcases/.

❌ If missing or broken:
Test cases cannot locate or interact with page elements.

Framework becomes unscalable — tests will mix logic and selectors.

📁 3. testcases/ — Your Actual Test Scripts
✅ What it contains:
All real-world test cases (e.g., test_search.py).

Uses page classes to perform actions and assert results.

🔗 Connection:
Uses page classes from pages/

Uses setup() fixture from base_test.py

Reads from configfiles/config.ini

❌ If missing or broken:
No automated test can be run.

You'll have setup but no test execution.

📁 4. utilities/ — Reusable Utility Functions
✅ What it contains:
custom_logger.py: Logs test status.

wait_utils.py: Extra waits if needed.

🔗 Connection:
Can be used in pages or testcases to handle logging or complex waits.

Optional but very useful for debugging and maintainability.

❌ If missing or broken:
Logs will not be saved.

Tests may fail silently without proper logs or screenshots.

📁 5. configfiles/ — Centralized Test Settings
✅ What it contains:
config.ini: Stores URL, credentials, search values, etc.

🔗 Connection:
Used in base_test.py and testcases/ to read environment-specific settings.

❌ If missing or broken:
Tests will fail due to missing input like base_url, search_item.

Hardcoding these in code is bad practice and limits environment flexibility.

📁 6. testdata/ — Test Inputs for Data-Driven Testing
✅ What it contains:
External data files like .json, .csv, .xlsx.

🔗 Connection:
Can be used in test cases to drive multiple tests with different inputs.

❌ If missing:
Tests that rely on external data will fail.

Other hardcoded tests will still work.

📁 7. screenshots/ — Error Snapshots
✅ What it contains:
Screenshots captured automatically when a step fails.

🔗 Connection:
Used inside base_page.py to capture UI at failure points.

❌ If folder missing:
Screenshot saving will raise an exception.

Best practice: always ensure this folder exists.

📁 8. reports/ — Test Logs and HTML Reports
✅ What it contains:
HTML report (report.html)

Optional: log file (framework.log from logger)

🔗 Connection:
pytest.ini saves reports here.

custom_logger.py writes test logs here.

❌ If missing:
Tests will run, but no logs or reports will be generated.

Debugging failures will be harder.

📁 Other Files
✅ conftest.py (optional now)
If needed, holds shared fixtures or hooks for all tests.

✅ pytest.ini
Configures report generation with HTML format.

✅ requirements.txt
List of dependencies to set up the environment.
